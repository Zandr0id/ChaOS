# ChaOS
Experimental operating system from the ground up


This is a personal project. Perhaps I'll open it up to others if it gets anywhere.
As a first set of goals, I want it to
1. Be able to boot. -DONE
2. Display text to the screen. -DONE
3. Accept keyboard input.
4. Have at least one timer working.
