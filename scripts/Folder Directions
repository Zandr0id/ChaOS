This is the location of any scripts that help me with development.
The test.sh and qemu_start.bat scripts run qemu and feed it the output .bin file.

I'm using the Ubuntu under linux in Visual Studio Code, with Bash as the terminal, so the shell script 
runs the bat file that then runs qemu to do the test.

Eventually there will also be a script here that creates bootable iso files
