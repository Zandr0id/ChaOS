NOTE: $@ is right of the :, and $< is the left

This project is made of .asm and .cpp files
Go into the SRC_DIR and lookd for any of those.
each file type needs to be located separatly because duplicate
names will mess up the search if I try to do it in one command

Put all the files together in one list
This is now a single list of every file that needs to be compiled together

strip the SRC_DIR/*.sufix and change to OBJ_DIR/*.o
After this, every file with .asm, .c, etc. now has a .o
This assumes for now that every file in the project is going into the same final output file
When I start building multiple output files, this will have to change somehow

kernel.bin is what the output file will be called

COMMON_FLAGS are flags used by both compilers.

Nasm, the assembler, and its flags in ASM and ASMFLAGS.

Build Order:

     - Assemble any .asm files and put them in the OBJS_DIR

     - Compile any .c files and put them in the OBJS_DIR

     - Compile and .cpp files and put them in the OBJS_DIR

.PHONY tells make that there will never be these files
